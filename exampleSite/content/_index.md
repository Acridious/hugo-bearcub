# Say hello to Bear Cub!

Today's websites are bloated, slow, and full of scripts, ads, and trackers. This
became so commonplace that we lost all sense of perspective, to the point that
we now think multi-megabyte webpages are normal.

> The internet has become a bloated mess. Huge JavaScript libraries, countless
> client-side queries and overly complex frontend frameworks are par for the
> course these days.

Let's change this one website at a time! **Bear Cub** is a
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme based on [Hugo
Bear](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) that takes care of speed and
optimization, so you can focus on writing good content.

It is free, **multilingual**, optimized for search engines, no-nonsense,
responsive, light, and fast. Really fast.

Additionally, when compared to its predecessor, Bear Cub was made with
[privacy](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=lente.dev),
[security](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/lente.dev) and
[accessibility](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Flente.dev%2F)
in mind. For more details on how to ensure your website keeps following these
guidelines, [check out my blog](https://lente.dev/en/posts/stone-websites/).
